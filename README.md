## 📊 Key Insights Summary
🧩 1. Booking Platform Analysis
The company utilizes 7 different booking platforms.

The highest number of bookings (55,066) came through the "Others" category, indicating potential unidentified or third-party aggregators.

Not only did "Others" bring the most bookings, it also contributed the highest revenue, highlighting the importance of understanding and optimizing this channel.

Platforms like Makeyourtrip and Logtrip followed with 26,898 and 14,756 bookings respectively.

🔍 Recommendation:
Investigate what platforms fall under "Others" and explore partnerships or branding opportunities to maximize this high-performing source.

🏨 2. Revenue by Hotel
Among the seven hotel branches, Atliq Exotica emerged as the top revenue generator, contributing over ₹32 Crores.

This was followed closely by Atliq Palace (₹30.4 Cr) and Atliq City (₹28.5 Cr).

🔍 Recommendation:
Analyze what’s driving performance at Atliq Exotica (location, pricing, service, amenities) and replicate successful strategies across underperforming properties like Atliq Seasons (₹6.6 Cr).

📍 3. City-Wise Occupancy (June)
Delhi leads with an occupancy rate of 62.47%, indicating high demand or effective marketing.

Other cities like Hyderabad (58.46%) and Mumbai (58.38%) show moderate performance.

Bangalore, while a key market, is slightly behind at 56.44%.

🔍 Recommendation:
Evaluate factors behind Delhi’s strong occupancy. For Bangalore, assess seasonal trends, pricing strategy, or competitive landscape to improve occupancy.

✅ Final Takeaways:
Unknown booking sources ("Others") are valuable and need clearer attribution.

Atliq Exotica is a strong performer — analyze and scale best practices.

City-specific occupancy data can inform regional campaigns and dynamic pricing strategies.
